My first website
Created my first recipe website to integrate the basic HTML concepts learned so far from the Odin Project. Utilized headings, paragraphs and the "ul" and "ol" listings to add consistency to the text. The alt attributes gave recognition to users with sight who are visually impaired to navigate easily.
